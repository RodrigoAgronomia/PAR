# DIFMR
R Package including various useful functions to work with spatial analysis of on-farm experiments.

The package is actively been developed and there is a discussion session every Friday. These are recorded and will be made available.

[DIFMR - 20190118](https://mediaspace.illinois.edu/media/t/1_a6hgsx13)  
First meeting to start the development of the DIFMR Package. We discussed the GitHub organization and the coding style.

[DIFMR - 20190125](https://mediaspace.illinois.edu/media/t/1_vpri95c1)  
Second meeting to continue the development of the DIFMR Package. We discussed the GitHub usage as a project management tool and the documentation. The first deliverable will be a set of functions to automate trial design.

Third meeting to continue the development of the DIFMR Package. We discussed the functions implemented for trial design, including the geometry definitions and the rates assignments. The second set of functions to be developed will focus on data standardization, cleaning, and aggregation.

Fourth meeting to continue the development of the DIFMR Package. We discussed the functions being implemented for data standardization, cleaning, and aggregation. Specific tasks were assigned and the results should be presented next meeting.

Fifth meeting to continue the development of the DIFMR Package. We presented some of the functions implemented last week, mainly for converting units and data standardization. We started the data aggregation process by interpolating all data to a common grid (raster). We also discussed the generation of an AB line from as applied data.

Sixth meeting to continue the development of the DIFMR Package. We discussed the data aggregation, starting with the pre-requisites of the files before they can be processed, the interpolation and the final aggregation into the polygons (observation units).  

[DIFMR - 20190308](https://mediaspace.illinois.edu/media/t/1_mo5goc4b)  
Seventh DIFMR meeting. The focus of this week will be on documenting and organizing the functions already developed. Each participant was assigned a set of functions to work with. The documentation should be ready before the next meeting.

[DIFMR - 20190315](https://mediaspace.illinois.edu/media/t/1_rd3ufcj7)  
Eighth DIFMR meeting. The focus of this meeting was to look into the documentation changes over the last week and discuss good practices while doing that. There are still many functions with incomplete documentation that should be changed. Including meaningful examples is also important. The last part of the meeting was about new developments, with the inclusion of new functions for trial designs. There will be no meeting next week due to the spring break.  

[DIFMR - 20190329](https://mediaspace.illinois.edu/media/t/1_34033upr)  
Nineth DIFMR meeting. We reviseted the functions implemented for trial design, explaining the new arguments and new functions that were incorporated. A complete example with variations was given. The last part of the meeting was for fixing problems in the computer of each participant, mainly due to improper GIT setup. 

[DIFMR - 20190405](https://mediaspace.illinois.edu/media/t/1_scjqyp22)  
Tenth DIFMR meeting. Another example of trial design, in a more challenging field, was presented. Most of the process is the same as shown before, but instead of using a single AB line, all the path lines must be available. The field was split into three parts to make the blocking easy and was merged together to produce a single map in the end. The last part was a demonstration of the functions being developed to integrate the package with a PostGIS database to store all the spatial data.
